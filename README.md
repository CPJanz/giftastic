Reactionary is a page that allows users to be shown a selection gifs of the selected category. 

## Description of features
New cagegories can be added by searching.
Images can be favorited and unfavorited.
Favorited images appear on the favorite page.
The list of favorited images persists between sessions (using the localStorage).

## Purpose
This was an assignment for coding bootcamp focusing on using third party APIs, manipulating the dom, and using the localStorage.


## Feedback
This project felt a little easier than the ones before. Although this may be due to my continued improvements in breaking down the work into more manageable pieces and my increased comfort with bootstrap.

I welcome any feedback on the choices I made (especially on the html and css side).
